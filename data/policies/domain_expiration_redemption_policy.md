# Domain Expiration and Redemption Policy

This policy defines the domain expiration lifecycle, renewal options, redemption rules, and support limitations.

---

## 1. Expiration Timeline

The domain lifecycle follows a fixed registry-defined timeline:

- **Day 0** – Domain expires
- **Day 1–30** – Grace period
- **Day 31–60** – Redemption period
- **Day 61+** – Pending deletion (irreversible)

Registry timelines may vary slightly by TLD but cannot be overridden.

---

## 2. Grace Period

- Domains may be renewed at the standard renewal cost
- Normal domain services are restored upon successful renewal
- No additional fees apply during this period

---

## 3. Redemption Period

- Domains enter redemption after the grace period ends
- An additional **redemption fee** is required to recover the domain
- Domain services remain offline until redemption is completed

---

## 4. Recovery Limitations

- Domains **cannot be recovered** once they enter pending deletion
- Deletion is final and controlled by the registry
- Re-registration may be possible only after full deletion and public release

---

## 5. Support Actions and Limitations

- Support teams may provide guidance on timelines and recovery options
- Support **cannot override** registry-imposed expiration or deletion timelines
- Exceptions are not permitted once registry thresholds are crossed
