# Domain Suspension Guidelines

This document defines when domains may be suspended, how customers are notified, and the conditions required for reactivation.

---

## 1. Overview

Domains may be suspended to protect users, comply with legal or regulatory requirements, or address policy violations.  
Suspension disables DNS resolution and associated services but does **not** immediately delete the domain.

---

## 2. Common Reasons for Suspension

Domains may be suspended for one or more of the following reasons:

- Inaccurate, missing, or unverified WHOIS information
- Abuse reports, including phishing, malware distribution, or spam
- Repeated billing or payment failures
- Court orders or regulatory enforcement actions

---

## 3. Notification Policy

### 3.1 Standard Notice

- Customers are typically notified prior to suspension
- Notifications are sent to the registered WHOIS or account email address

### 3.2 No-Notice Suspensions

Immediate suspension may occur without prior notice in cases involving:

- Active phishing, malware, or security threats
- Requests from law enforcement or regulatory bodies
- Severe or repeated policy violations posing immediate risk

---

## 4. Reactivation Requirements

### 4.1 General Requirements

To be eligible for reactivation:
- The underlying suspension issue must be fully resolved
- The domain must remain within an allowable registry recovery state

---

### 4.2 Missing or Inaccurate WHOIS Information

- Customer must update WHOIS information
- WHOIS email verification must be completed
- Reactivation typically occurs within **24 hours** after successful verification

---

### 4.3 Policy Violation or Abuse-Related Suspensions

- Each case must be reviewed by the **Abuse Team**
- Customers may be required to provide remediation or cleanup evidence
- Support agents must **not** manually reactivate domains without explicit approval

---

## 5. Escalation and Ownership

Suspension cases are escalated based on the root cause:

- WHOIS-related suspensions → **Support Team**
- Abuse-related suspensions → **Abuse Team**
- Legal or regulatory suspensions → **Legal Operations**
