# Abuse Escalation Runbook

This runbook outlines when abuse cases must be escalated, the information required for escalation, and actions that support teams are not permitted to perform.

## 1. When to Escalate

Abuse cases must be escalated to the **Abuse Team** under the following conditions:

- Confirmed or suspected phishing activity
- Malware hosting or distribution
- Repeat or recurring abuse offenses associated with a domain or account

---

## 2. Required Information for Escalation

The following information must be collected before escalation:

- Affected domain name(s)
- Abuse report or case reference ID
- Summary of customer remediation steps taken (if any)
- Relevant timestamps or supporting evidence, where available

Incomplete escalation requests may delay review.
