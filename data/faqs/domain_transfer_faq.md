# Domain Transfer FAQ

1. Why is my domain locked?

Domains are locked by default to prevent unauthorized or accidental transfers.  
A locked domain cannot be transferred until it is manually unlocked by the domain owner.

2. How do I unlock my domain?

You can unlock your domain from your account dashboard:

- Sign in to your account
- Go to Domain Management
- Select the domain you want to transfer
- Disable the domain lock option

The change usually takes effect immediately.

3. Are suspended domains transferable?

No.  
Domains must be active and in good standing to be transferred. Suspended or expired domains are not eligible for transfer.
