<!-- METADATA: {'section': 'Domain Suspension FAQ', 'source_file': 'faqs/domain_suspension_faq.md', 'category': 'faqs'} -->

This document addresses common questions related to domain suspensions and reactivation.  
---  
1. Why was my domain suspended?  
Domains may be suspended for several reasons, including but not limited to:
- Inaccurate or unverified WHOIS information
- Abuse complaints (such as phishing, malware, or spam)
- Billing or payment issues  
The specific reason depends on the nature of the violation.  
---  
2. I didn’t receive any notice. Why?  
In some cases, domains may be suspended immediately without prior notice.
This typically occurs when the suspension is required for:
- Abuse mitigation
- Legal or regulatory compliance
- Security threats  
---  
3. How do I reactivate my domain?  
To reactivate your domain, you must resolve the issue that caused the suspension.
Reactivation steps vary depending on the suspension reason and will be provided in your account dashboard or support communication.  
---  
4. How long does reactivation take?  
Most domain reactivations are completed within **24 hours** after the underlying issue has been resolved.
In rare cases, additional review time may be required.

<!-- METADATA: {'section': 'Domain Transfer FAQ', 'source_file': 'faqs/domain_transfer_faq.md', 'category': 'faqs'} -->

1. Why is my domain locked?  
Domains are locked by default to prevent unauthorized or accidental transfers.
A locked domain cannot be transferred until it is manually unlocked by the domain owner.  
2. How do I unlock my domain?  
You can unlock your domain from your account dashboard:  
- Sign in to your account
- Go to Domain Management
- Select the domain you want to transfer
- Disable the domain lock option  
The change usually takes effect immediately.  
3. Are suspended domains transferable?  
No.
Domains must be active and in good standing to be transferred. Suspended or expired domains are not eligible for transfer.

<!-- METADATA: {'section': 'WHOIS FAQ', 'source_file': 'faqs/whois_faq.md', 'category': 'faqs'} -->

This document explains common questions related to WHOIS information and verification requirements.  
---  
1. What is WHOIS?  
WHOIS refers to the public registration information associated with a domain name.
It typically includes details such as the registrant’s contact information and domain status, subject to privacy settings.  
---  
2. Why do I need to verify my WHOIS email?  
WHOIS email verification is required to comply with **ICANN regulations**.
Verification helps ensure the accuracy of domain ownership information and enables registrars to contact domain holders when necessary.  
---  
3. What happens if I don’t verify my WHOIS information?  
If WHOIS verification is not completed within the required timeframe, your domain may be **suspended** until verification is successfully completed.
